1094 I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,
445 A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,
436 A Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,
1292 Open your scarf’d chops till I blow grit within you,
234 I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,
60 Urge and urge and urge,
195 For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,
56 Nor any more youth or age than there is now,
852 Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,
1043 We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,
1311 I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,
466 
1162 My captain lash’d fast with his own hands.
53 But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.
438 A boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye;
360 The pure contralto sings in the organ loft,
316 
498 
323 
1747 I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,
567 Have you outstript the rest? are you the President?
1081 The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,
1238 38
1723 Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,
790 Ah this indeed is music—this suits me.
536 
191 Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,
1316 Every room of the house do I fill with an arm’d force,
1631 But roughs and little children better than they.
41 Have you reckon’d a thousand acres much? have you reckon’d the earth much?
1478 Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister?
204 I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my hand.
1377 Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,
378 The young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him, though I do not know him;)
1677 I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,
303 The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,
1587 You are also asking me questions and I hear you,
1143 The maim’d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,
362 The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner,
798 It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick’d by the indolent waves,
1391 The mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories, stocks, stores, real estate and personal estate.
1083 
1321 I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,
412 Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather’d, it is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes of cannon and small arms!)
1515 O span of youth! ever-push’d elasticity!
285 The beards of the young men glisten’d with wet, it ran from their long hair,
51 3
1100 They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.
37 The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,
446 Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,
1038 
818 Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,
984 Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, weeps,
901 I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain’d,
1103 I am there again.
483 19
4 I celebrate myself, and sing myself,
354 Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,
1114 The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.
1199 36
1337 In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix engraved,
390 The young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the knots,
1246 That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning.
1744 It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow’d wilds,
1443 And what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all, precisely the same.
1465 I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.
1519 Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,
1691 
562 
1152 35
1280 
48 You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,
1210 Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,
208 
669 Through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the current and index.
1031 My course runs below the soundings of plummets.
639 I accept Reality and dare not question it,
802 At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,
624 There is no better than it and now.
121 And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart,
1422 Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist,
666 Whoever degrades another degrades me,
537 I know I am august,
1060 The courage of present times and all times,
1712 
1562 No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,
493 This the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,
5 And what I assume you shall assume,
1363 My own voice, orotund sweeping and final.
633 A word of the faith that never balks,
1612 Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over all latherers,
343 I see in them and myself the same old law.
783 (They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)
132 
370 The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm’d case,
1382 
1566 My left hand hooking you round the waist,
1209 Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,
398 The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray,
954 Over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower’d cotton plant, over the rice in its low moist field,
621 Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.
734 The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,
298 
870 And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,
625 
1288 Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,
231 
47 You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,
576 
123 
288 An unseen hand also pass’d over their bodies,
278 
1564 I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,
1118 
1600 To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout, and laughingly dash with your hair.
379 The half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,
807 (Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,)
1700 
210 I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol has fallen.
825 Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,
1520 Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at night,
938 What I guess’d while I lay alone in my bed,
342 The brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings,
32 Echoes, ripples, buzz’d whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,
527 And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.
892 In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,
434 One of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the largest the same,
1696 
464 This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is,
452 And am not stuck up, and am in my place.
388 The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut eyes bent sideways,
752 Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of articulation,
964 Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides,
311 His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead,
763 
1571 
1125 
843 Unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.
662 
1367 Now the performer launches his nerve, he has pass’d his prelude on the reeds within.
395 The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him,
1355 Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream’d,
557 The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate into a new tongue.
876 I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,
1027 I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,
350 Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls, and the drivers of horses,
1300 To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,
228 The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,
404 (Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)
968 Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it myself and looking composedly down,)
68 Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the beams,
830 No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,
1203 The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet,
1668 In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,
1408 In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture—but the host and hostess, and the look out of their eyes?
116 Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the best,
1517 
1204 Near by the corpse of the child that serv’d in the cabin,
382 The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,
431 Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,
1606 
933 Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you.
773 I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,
87 That they turn from gazing after and down the road,
192 For me those that have been boys and that love women,
731 Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,
1742 
253 Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders,
1022 Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,
1561 My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from the woods,
75 Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.
782 The slow march play’d at the head of the association marching two and two,
1426 To the mass kneeling or the puritan’s prayer rising, or sitting patiently in a pew,
631 And mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.
