1338 With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and image,
163 And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.
913 
1077 I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,
1591 Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,
106 Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.
1680 
1339 Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,
745 My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,
1086 My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.
758 Happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day.)
325 They rise together, they slowly circle around.
776 Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of work-people at their meals,
931 I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,
46 You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,)
1609 Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,
1251 Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.
1364 
1559 
747 
418 Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or Altamahaw,
1092 They have clear’d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.
998 Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well,
241 Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill’d game,
570 I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,
1736 
1583 This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look’d at the crowded heaven,
806 To be in any form, what is that?
543 If no other in the world be aware I sit content,
881 And the cow crunching with depress’d head surpasses any statue,
110 
1255 Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,
563 I chant the chant of dilation or pride,
1314 
793 The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.
492 This the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,
170 
922 
538 I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,
16 Creeds and schools in abeyance,
1124 ’Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men.
1142 A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead lay together,
664 Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!
332 And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.
1174 Our frigate takes fire,
1102 I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort’s bombardment,
489 There shall be no difference between them and the rest.
794 
1702 There is that in me—I do not know what it is—but I know it is in me.
1651 And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one’s self is,
1009 My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;
1179 We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part of the fighting.
769 Now I will do nothing but listen,
1470 There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.
40 
1610 Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts,
336 Ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,
428 
1301 On his right cheek I put the family kiss,
1531 
1746 
891 In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder’d bones,
1499 Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen,
1593 
990 Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived swan is curving and winding,
1394 I am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or fleas,)
1454 Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder,
819 Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,
1348 Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr’d laths, their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;
277 Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.
482 
1005 Pleas’d with the tune of the choir of the whitewash’d church,
555 I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,
888 
45 Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,
801 
1679 And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.
25 
225 
1423 Drinking mead from the skull-cup, to Shastas and Vedas admirant, minding the Koran,
1047 We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged,
910 
1482 
1014 Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,
502 
27 It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,
1291 You there, impotent, loose in the knees,
1605 He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.
1595 Now I wash the gum from your eyes,
1324 41
393 The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the reporter’s lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the sign-painter is lettering with blue and gold,
1429 Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.
1451 Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side,
1313 By God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight upon me.
223 Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips,
1137 The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer,
294 
1436 
162 O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,
117 Only the lull I like, the hum of your valvèd voice.
850 Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.
571 I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.
1389 This is the city and I am one of the citizens,
194 For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the mothers of mothers,
1006 Pleas’d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher, impress’d seriously at the camp-meeting;
1468 
1471 
365 
753 Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?
265 He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass’d north,
1504 My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.
997 Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,
59 
1416 My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,
1374 
1304 On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes.
911 So they show their relations to me and I accept them,
610 
1751 If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.
940 
604 Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others’ arms.
324 My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and day-long ramble,
580 Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!
134 A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;
1516 O manhood, balanced, florid and full.
1654 And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times,
583 Far-swooping elbow’d earth—rich apple-blossom’d earth!
1248 I remember now,
247 
1340 Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days,
193 For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,
1187 
867 
1181 Only three guns are in use,
1353 What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me, and not filling the square rod then,
1495 
1492 And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.
1011 Far from the settlements studying the print of animals’ feet, or the moccasin print,
655 And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire.
1588 I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.
1373 Folks are around me, but they are no household of mine.
712 Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!
416 Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood or pecan-trees,
572 
1067 How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp’d unshaved men;
717 Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,
1706 
1563 I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,
1464 What is known I strip away,
1727 Very well then I contradict myself,
377 The machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his beat, the gate-keeper marks who pass,
896 In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,
1229 
679 And of the rights of them the others are down upon,
1667 I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,
1440 Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,
637 That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.
541 
457 
757 My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things,
862 Logic and sermons never convince,
1592 But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence.
716 I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,
1205 The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl’d whiskers,
1368 
429 16
1557 46
762 I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.
873 And until one and all shall delight us, and we them.
1365 Come my children,
212 The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the promenaders,
38 The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides,
609 I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also.
971 Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,
668 
1110 The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim’d shots,
