403 The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to each other,
224 I mind them or the show or resonance of them—I come and I depart.
942 I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,
1568 
1527 Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days!
1079 I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn’d with the ooze of my skin,
308 The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags underneath on its tied-over chain,
439 At home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with fishermen off Newfoundland,
1335 Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,
1738 The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab and my loitering.
81 Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest.
1403 Not words of routine this song of mine,
800 Steep’d amid honey’d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,
456 The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)
1756 
95 My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,
1630 No shutter’d room or school can commune with me,
684 Voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil’d and I remove the veil,
842 You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat,
748 Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,
119 I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,
875 31
227 The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,
598 Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,
226 9
844 
578 Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!
908 Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,
1277 40
1653 And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth,
1450 It cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,
510 What is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?
652 Less the reminders of properties told my words,
834 The sentries desert every other part of me,
1551 Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.
988 Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,
1369 Easily written loose-finger’d chords—I feel the thrum of your climax and close.
261 And brought water and fill’d a tub for his sweated body and bruis’d feet,
822 On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,
274 She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.
269 Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,
626 What behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not such a wonder,
646 This is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a mathematician.
522 
135 How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.
1497 Faithful and friendly the arms that have help’d me.
863 The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.
475 I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.
1184 
1357 The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the best, and be as prodigious;
1128 Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,
1146 A youth not seventeen years old seiz’d his assassin till two more came to release him,
540 (I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.)
749 It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,
909 Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.
29 I am mad for it to be in contact with me.
1272 Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, uncomb’d head, laughter, and naiveté,
1221 See myself in prison shaped like another man,
720 
1619 I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while I wait for a boat,
1640 On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me.
64 Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.
623 This minute that comes to me over the past decillions,
1166 
966 Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,
1665 
1306 
347 
1346 Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me than the gods of the antique wars,
1430 
1113 The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,
1298 You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you.
874 
838 I am given up by traitors,
172 The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,
977 Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,
1231 
577 Smile O voluptuous cool-breath’d earth!
1054 I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.
824 Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,
689 Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.
478 And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!
80 Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean,
1310 
1350 Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts bagg’d out at their waists,
1192 
1548 They are but parts, any thing is but a part.
1061 How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,
409 As the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by the jingling of loose change,
903 
1375 Ever the hard unsunk ground,
1413 
925 Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,
1395 I acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and shallowest is deathless with me,
614 I moisten the roots of all that has grown.
1407 The black ship mail’d with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets—but the pluck of the captain and engineers?
329 And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,
1252 
927 
1415 I do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,
260 And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,
1271 
499 Do you take it I would astonish?
1536 Outward and outward and forever outward.
432 Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,
803 And that we call Being.
1701 50
392 The clean-hair’d Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine or in the factory or mill,
143 Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.
649 Your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,
200 And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.
1554 The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,
1096 White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared of their fire-caps,
1066 How the lank loose-gown’d women look’d when boated from the side of their prepared graves,
177 And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.
314 I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop there,
28 I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,
1639 On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do not fail them,
1219 In at the conquer’d doors they crowd! I am possess’d!
1328 I heard what was said of the universe,
500 Does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering through the woods?
660 No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,
1645 The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are,
34 The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color’d sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,
1139 
1748 I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.
408 The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle,
1032 
565 I show that size is only development.
1672 
1601 
460 If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or next to nothing,
714 Hands I have taken, face I have kiss’d, mortal I have ever touch’d, it shall be you.
344 
420 Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons around them,
1 BY WALT WHITMAN
688 I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,
77 Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,
433 Stuff’d with the stuff that is coarse and stuff’d with the stuff that is fine,
54 
1740 I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,
1123 The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)
1234 
511 
1084 Agonies are one of my changes of garments,
554 21
1681 And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not offend me,
31 The smoke of my own breath,
97 The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,
286 Little streams pass’d all over their bodies.
912 They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their possession.
1284 Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,
174 And ceas’d the moment life appear’d.
1116 Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves with his hand,
396 The child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,
672 By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.
1715 Do you see O my brothers and sisters?
795 I hear the train’d soprano (what work with hers is this?)
494 This the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.
950 Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the buck turns furiously at the hunter,
1073 The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing, cover’d with sweat,
516 That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.
1194 He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,
542 I exist as I am, that is enough,
1122 Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,
1224 For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,
657 24
1752 
1405 This printed and bound book—but the printer and the printing-office boy?
1052 I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,
1666 Why should I wish to see God better than this day?
1396 What I do and say the same waits for them,
1228 (I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching lips.)
1275 They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly out of the glance of his eyes.
113 And you must not be abased to the other.
1211 A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,
