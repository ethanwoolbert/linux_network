345 The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,
904 They do not sweat and whine about their condition,
1676 To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,
809 
468 With music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,
385 The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof’d garret and harks to the musical rain,
161 
986 Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,
607 (Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that supports them?)
930 
796 The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,
1068 All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,
564 We have had ducking and deprecating about enough,
1496 Immense have been the preparations for me,
232 I am there, I help, I came stretch’d atop of the load,
991 Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human laugh,
868 A minute and a drop of me settle my brain,
1025 I tread day and night such roads.
1334 Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,
1159 Along the lower’d eve he came horribly raking us.
334 14
473 
501 Do I astonish more than they?
282 Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,
153 It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,
83 I am satisfied—I see, dance, laugh, sing;
376 The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by the bar-room stove,
1065 How he saved the drifting company at last,
1286 And might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and days.
1133 Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,
1002 Pleas’d with the native and pleas’d with the foreign, pleas’d with the new and old,
1040 
832 Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.
1650 And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,
406 On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms,
1452 Nor the little child that peep’d in at the door, and then drew back and was never seen again,
1402 
602 
1240 Somehow I have been stunn’d. Stand back!
1648 48
686 
1134 Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,
129 And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,
1628 The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.
979 Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base-ball,
1506 For it the nebula cohered to an orb,
1435 I know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt, despair and unbelief.
1200 Stretch’d and still lies the midnight,
1578 
90 
1633 The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,
1686 (No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)
759 
477 Vivas to those who have fail’d!
1574 Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.
550 My foothold is tenon’d and mortis’d in granite,
1550 See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,
1694 Toss, sparkles of day and dusk—toss on the black stems that decay in the muck,
1663 I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,
1274 They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,
1381 Ever the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.
695 The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,
1341 (They bore mites as for unfledg’d birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves,)
1534 
1290 
1030 I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,
289 It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.
156 And here you are the mothers’ laps.
168 What do you think has become of the young and old men?
711 You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!
840 I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.
845 29
1188 Not a moment’s cease,
348 I am enamour’d of growing out-doors,
300 Each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in the fire.
1270 They desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them, stay with them.
419 
530 To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,
1111 The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,
1296 
1705 I sleep—I sleep long.
1259 Continue your annotations, continue your questionings.
581 Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!
1684 
1265 Is he some Southwesterner rais’d out-doors? is he Kanadian?
358 
322 It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.
509 
733 
187 I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,
1243 
1281 Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,
1183 Two well serv’d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks.
723 
1577 Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.
893 In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,
1480 All has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,
1161 We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch’d,
784 
582 Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!
165 I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,
1732 Who has done his day’s work? who will soonest be through with his supper?
654 And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and women fully equipt,
1406 The well-taken photographs—but your wife or friend close and solid in your arms?
248 The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,
1753 You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,
1501 They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.
573 Press close bare-bosom’d night—press close magnetic nourishing night!
985 Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are scatter’d, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,
906 They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,
487 The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,
425 And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,
936 Space and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess’d at,
1660 For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,
435 A Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and hospitable down by the Oconee I live,
587 O unspeakable passionate love.
1326 And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.
1245 That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludgeons and hammers!
1538 My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,
1037 My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.
1616 I follow you whoever you are from the present hour,
996 Where the yellow-crown’d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs,
770 To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.
421 In walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after their day’s sport,
124 Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,
726 The air tastes good to my palate.
154 It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,
1555 The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be there.
137 I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.
732 Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.
1023 Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,
1112 Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,
443 Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and meat,
1062 How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights,
575 Still nodding night—mad naked summer night.
1097 The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.
486 I will not have a single person slighted or left away,
1404 But abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;
638 
1623 I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house,
1543 If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would not avail in the long run,
474 I beat and pound for the dead,
252 I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west, the bride was a red girl,
96 The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,
9 I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.
305 They do not hasten, each man hits in his place.
1198 
262 And gave him a room that enter’d from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,
105 Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,
1289 When I give I give myself.
702 Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!
1556 
755 The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,
175 
491 This is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of hair,
1552 
183 I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash’d babe, and am not contain’d between my hat and boots,
340 The sharp-hoof’d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the chickadee, the prairie-dog,
441 At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine, or the Texan ranch,
779 The heave’e’yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the refrain of the anchor-lifters,
1285 And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,
671 I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,
751 
722 A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.
1148 
766 With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.
1547 A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the span or make it impatient,
781 The steam whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,
109 I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.
1145 These were despatch’d with bayonets or batter’d with the blunts of muskets,
698 If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it,
140 A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,
548 I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.
1098 
1687 
1050 The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe.
