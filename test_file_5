574 Night of south winds—night of the large few stars!
923 A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,
405 The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great Secretaries,
397 The regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the white sails sparkle!)
485 It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, I make appointments with all,
947 Weeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,
1207 The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,
319 Absorbing all to myself and for this song.
1003 Pleas’d with the homely woman as well as the handsome,
371 (He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother’s bed-room;)
1549 
463 
102 Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,
1135 Not a single one over thirty years of age.
375 What is removed drops horribly in a pail;
453 
72 Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.
1250 The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,
1261 39
659 Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding,
692 Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.
851 
878 And the tree-toad is a chef-d’œuvre for the highest,
364 The mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon are ready,
1172 They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.
1489 Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,
149 
1361 42
1584 And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them, shall we be fill’d and satisfied then?
20 
1170 
1241 Give me a little time beyond my cuff’d head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,
1678 I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,
569 
1627 The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves a key,
1315 I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,
1458 Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit them,
1095 Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,
1078 Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,
36 A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,
724 To behold the day-break!
969 Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,
1714 
133 6
1472 Births have brought us richness and variety,
1737 52
101 
596 
503 This hour I tell things in confidence,
826 Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,
291 The young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,
1731 
1226 
848 
1662 
1202 Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the one we have conquer’d,
1351 The snag-tooth’d hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come,
108 Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders,
120 How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn’d over upon me,
451 Breathe the air but leave plenty after me,
1169 The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for themselves.
644 This is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a grammar of the old cartouches,
1121 (I tell not the fall of Alamo,
1664 Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.
1467 The clock indicates the moment—but what does eternity indicate?
889 In vain the speeding or shyness,
1008 Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn’d up to the clouds, or down a lane or along the beach,
238 Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,
811 I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,
459 These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me,
928 His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,
856 All truths wait in all things,
1090 Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,
1642 My face rubs to the hunter’s face when he lies down alone in his blanket,
821 My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself,
1759 I stop somewhere waiting for you.
1656 And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel’d universe,
1013 Nigh the coffin’d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;
1634 The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day,
1469 We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,
1233 My face is ash-color’d, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.
1282 Say, old top-knot, what do you want?
86 Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,
326 
561 And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.
229 The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,
1333 Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,
255 She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach’d to her feet.
869 I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,
905 They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,
307 13
917 Myself moving forward then and now and forever,
853 Landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.
0 Song of Myself (1892 version)
1507 The long slow strata piled to rest it on,
1670 And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe’er I go,
941 My ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,
386 The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,
645 These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas.
839 I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the greatest traitor,
804 
1428 Looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement and land,
1528 
1165 On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.
222 What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls restrain’d by decorum,
189 (They do not know how immortal, but I know.)
1409 The sky up there—yet here or next door, or across the way?
1223 
1151 
1427 Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like till my spirit arouses me,
118 
1319 Sleep—I and they keep guard all night,
490 
70 I and this mystery here we stand.
627 The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel.
1604 He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own,
1692 Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,
741 
965 Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;
296 The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market,
1074 The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous buckshot and the bullets,
114 
1729 
772 I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals,
937 What I guess’d when I loaf’d on the grass,
739 Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,
167 
1147 The three were all torn and cover’d with the boy’s blood.
442 Comrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners, (loving their big proportions,)
1586 
636 It alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,
1716 It is not chaos or death—it is form, union, plan—it is eternal life—it is Happiness.
1580 And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,
1370 
632 
1638 The soldier camp’d or upon the march is mine,
786 I hear the key’d cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,
476 
1138 The work commenced about five o’clock and was over by eight.
1349 By the mechanic’s wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person born,
380 The western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean on their rifles, some sit on logs,
15 
407 The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold,
600 Howler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,
1647 
400 The bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock moves slowly,
628 
328 And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,
1525 Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.
1581 For after we start we never lie by again.
44 
902 I stand and look at them long and long.
126 And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,
1447 
1076 
727 
1239 Enough! enough! enough!
787 It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.
846 Blind loving wrestling touch, sheath’d hooded sharp-tooth’d touch!
205 
1617 My words itch at your ears till you understand them.
857 They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,
961 Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,
1119 34
107 
505 
272 
1719 The past and present wilt—I have fill’d them, emptied them,
566 
1168 Ten o’clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported,
812 They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.
1537 
423 The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,
