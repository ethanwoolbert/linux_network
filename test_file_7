658 Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,
1437 How the flukes splash!
1158 His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be;
512 All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,
1201 Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,
1446 But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.
1444 
1509 Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with care.
366 The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,
78 Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.
283 The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.
1758 Missing me one place search another,
399 The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser higgling about the odd cent;)
1567 My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.
630 Endless unfolding of words of ages!
1728 (I am large, I contain multitudes.)
1327 
962 Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great gold-bug drops through the dark,
243 
523 Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel’d with doctors and calculated close,
742 We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,
691 I believe in the flesh and the appetites,
1704 Wrench’d and sweaty—calm and cool then my body becomes,
808 If nothing lay more develop’d the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.
372 The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,
239 Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,
1029 
1044 Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,
973 Where the half-burn’d brig is riding on unknown currents,
789 I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,
1590 Sit a while dear son,
1685 And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths,
1596 You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life.
1317 Lovers of me, bafflers of graves.
368 The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel,
855 30
987 Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks,
589 22
525 
1421 Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,
141 Bearing the owner’s name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say Whose?
706 Root of wash’d sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!
1523 Lighting on every moment of my life,
104 Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,
1532 I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,
1481 (What have I to do with lamentation?)
268 11
125 And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,
1230 Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried and sentenced.
49 You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.
301 
198 Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,
1453 Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with bitterness worse than gall,
84 As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread,
1163 
1215 These so, these irretrievable.
42 Have you practis’d so long to learn to read?
805 27
484 This is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,
1293 Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets,
1721 
1323 
515 I do not snivel that snivel the world over,
687 I do not press my fingers across my mouth,
251 
612 Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand indifferent,
827 Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,
1726 Do I contradict myself?
1262 The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?
1020 Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand miles,
1191 One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.
335 The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,
1512 Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.
1343 Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,
1611 First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull’s eye, to sail a skiff, to sing a song or play on the banjo,
139 Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,
943 I am afoot with my vision.
1089 Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,
960 Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,
220 What groans of over-fed or half-starv’d who fall sunstruck or in fits,
1182 One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy’s mainmast,
279 Where are you off to, lady? for I see you,
176 All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,
1278 Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask—lie over!
1710 Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,
1256 The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.
1540 And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.
833 
458 17
606 I am he attesting sympathy,
1411 Sermons, creeds, theology—but the fathomless human brain,
1621 Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen’d.)
341 The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,
1514 45
866 Only what nobody denies is so.)
254 On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,
1745 It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.
321 Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what is that you express in your eyes?
1632 
22 Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with perfumes,
974 Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;
673 
1028 And look at quintillions ripen’d and look at quintillions green.
1539 He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,
777 The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,
91 4
1505 
182 
678 And of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff,
715 
914 I wonder where they get those tokens,
374 The malform’d limbs are tied to the surgeon’s table,
513 Else it were time lost listening to me.
357 Scattering it freely forever.
650 I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.
65 
1045 The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is plain in all directions,
152 Tenderly will I use you curling grass,
1309 Let the physician and the priest go home.
1652 And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud,
1575 
1500 For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,
1476 That which fills its period and place is equal to any.
1303 
690 
729 Scooting obliquely high and low.
882 And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.
1080 I fall on the weeds and stones,
619 I find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance,
164 
1268 
410 The floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the roof, the masons are calling for mortar,
890 In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,
1070 
1108 
71 
788 
266 I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean’d in the corner.
1376 Ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward sun, ever the air and the ceaseless tides,
1185 The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top,
1730 I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.
1379 Ever the vexer’s hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides and bring him forth,
61 Always the procreant urge of the world.
847 Did it make you ache so, leaving me?
648 Gentlemen, to you the first honors always!
18 I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,
1545 And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.
613 My gait is no fault-finder’s or rejecter’s gait,
735 The heav’d challenge from the east that moment over my head,
1521 Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and chirping over my head,
422 The city sleeps and the country sleeps,
661 No more modest than immodest.
1695 Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.
1461 44
171 They are alive and well somewhere,
764 Writing and talk do not prove me,
13 I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,
315 I go with the team also.
676 Voices of the diseas’d and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,
1618 
642 Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!
629 23
235 And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.
93 People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live in, or the nation,
957 Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with the rest,
151 
718 I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish,
590 You sea! I resign myself to you also—I guess what you mean,
128 And that a kelson of the creation is love,
353 What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,
1263 Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?
1524 Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,
594 Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,
196 For me children and the begetters of children.
814 I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,
