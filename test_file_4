820 Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,
1220 Embody all presences outlaw’d or suffering,
1072 The mother of old, condemn’d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing on,
1494 Long I was hugg’d close—long and long.
1049 Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin’d city,
1085 I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the wounded person,
471 Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?
1197 Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.
190 
63 Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex,
242 Falling asleep on the gather’d leaves with my dog and gun by my side.
444 A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,
719 Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the friendship I take again.
1743 The last scud of day holds back for me,
1141 Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,
1690 If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?
26 The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is odorless,
579 Earth of departed sunset—earth of the mountains misty-topt!
1156 
1046 The white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my fancies toward them,
1699 And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.
394 The canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts at his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,
1439 
992 Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds,
1546 
935 33
721 That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,
1608 Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,
1344 Putting higher claims for him there with his roll’d-up sleeves driving the mallet and chisel,
949 Scorch’d ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the shallow river,
1385 Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once going,
1477 
1544 We should surely bring up again where we now stand,
854 
603 Partaker of influx and efflux I, extoller of hate and conciliation,
58 Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.
1419 Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting the sun,
1463 
173 And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it,
320 
1739 
237 10
886 And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,
62 
1418 Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years,
73 
7 
469 I play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches for conquer’d and slain persons.

257 The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,
330 And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else,
127 And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers,
1190 
506 20
1448 Each who passes is consider’d, each who stops is consider’d, not a single one can it fail.
275 
697 
1384 To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,
8 I loafe and invite my soul,
1345 Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation,
270 Twenty-eight young men and all so friendly;
982 At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,
1017 Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,
738 25
883 
1091 I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,
1267 The mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?
1359 Putting myself here and now to the ambush’d womb of the shadows.
352 
1560 I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)
1388 
1322 And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.
1708 It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.
533 I know I am deathless,
1018 Walking the old hills of Judæa with the beautiful gentle God by my side,
919 Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,
306 
1486 On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps,
944 
700 Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you!
1718 51
1273 Slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and emanations,
250 You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.
983 At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings;
1703 
728 Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding,
1420 Making a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with sticks in the circle of obis,
1371 My head slues round on my neck,
887 But call any thing back again when I desire it.
681 Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.
1535 Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,
1034 No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.
955 Over the sharp-peak’d farm house, with its scallop’d scum and slender shoots from the gutters,
313 
1173 
709 Sun so generous it shall be you!
1157 Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)
69 Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,
249 I tuck’d my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;
740 If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.
448 Prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.
1457 Nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of the earth,
1127 Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy’s, nine times their number, was the price they took in advance,
297 I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.
546 One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is myself,
1015 Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,
1711 To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.
605 
899 
864 
1342 Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself, bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see,
1717 
1299 
1644 The young mother and old mother comprehend me,
1602 47
704 Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!
552 And I know the amplitude of time.
1360 
837 
1051 
1503 Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me,
1649 I have said that the soul is not more than the body,
643 Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,
1432 
768 26
934 
1276 
1755 And filter and fibre your blood.
836 They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.
616 Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?
1218 You laggards there on guard! look to your arms!
1117 He gasps through the clot Mind not me—mind—the entrenchments.
112 I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,
461 If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing,
656 
877 And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren,
144 
57 And will never be any more perfection than there is now,
157 
82 
926 Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.
1010 Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek’d bush-boy, (behind me he rides at the drape of the day,)
1637 
1493 
1466 
1236 I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.
299 Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,
284 
6 For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.
103 Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,
608 
953 Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail;
1001 Through the gymnasium, through the curtain’d saloon, through the office or public hall;
885 And am stucco’d with quadrupeds and birds all over,
1598 Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,
1007 Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,
19 Nature without check with original energy.
39 The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun.
12 Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same,
1734 
521 Why should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?
197 
276 Which of the young men does she like the best?
1757 Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,
147 Growing among black folks as among white,
1484 
215 The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous’d mobs,
771 
1082 Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.
713 Broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you!
797 It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess’d them,
861
