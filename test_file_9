1483 I am an acme of things accomplish’d, and I an encloser of things to be.
111 5
92 Trippers and askers surround me,
907 Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things,
384 The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their partners, the dancers bow to each other,
290 
413 Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground;
895 In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,
1750 I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,
1131 They were the glory of the race of rangers,
1682 I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,
1629 
312 The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of his polish’d and perfect limbs.
959 Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged limbs,
1689 O suns—O grass of graves—O perpetual transfers and promotions,
130 And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,
1386 Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for payment receiving,
1459 Nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.
1305 (This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.)
201 
1253 I troop forth replenish’d with supreme power, one of an average unending procession,
55 There was never any more inception than there is now,
159 Darker than the colorless beards of old men,
708 Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!
865 (Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,
337 The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,
217 The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,
52 I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the end,
1433 Down-hearted doubters dull and excluded,
531 All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.
1622 
1104 
264 And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;
529 I know I am solid and sound,
389 As the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for the shore-going passengers,
1154 Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?
142 
1329 Heard it and heard it of several thousand years;
1378 Ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn’d thumb, that breath of itches and thirsts,
921 Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.
526 In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,
1150 That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.
1352 Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery;
924 Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,
1130 
76 
1140 None obey’d the command to kneel,
85 Leaving me baskets cover’d with white towels swelling the house with their plenty,
1039 I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.
1132 Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,
1522 Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,
967 Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs,
339 
10 
1582 
1242 I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.
958 Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;
1053 I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,
1356 The supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to be one of the supremes,
148 Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.
50 
1709 
519 I wear my hat as I please indoors or out.
359 15
651 
667 And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.
1186 They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.
1488 
879 And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,
1572 It is not far, it is within reach,
467 18
744 
1412 And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?
1041 I ascend to the foretruck,
1635 The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice,
240 In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,
514 
963 Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow,
1674 And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to try to alarm me.
1269 Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,
115 Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,
1366 Come my boys and girls, my women, household and intimates,
3 1
1244 That I could forget the mockers and insults!
1573 Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know,
351 I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.
258 I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,
88 And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,
999 Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,
1237 
1063 And chalk’d in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will not desert you;
1553 My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,
1149 At eleven o’clock began the burning of the bodies;
653 And more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,
586 Prodigal, you have given me love—therefore I to you give love!
1655 And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero,
480 And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes!
1424 Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife, beating the serpent-skin drum,
765 I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,
618 
454 (The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place,
1698 I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected,
1754 But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,
462 If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.
1019 Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,
799 I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,
835 They have left me helpless to a red marauder,
1193 Serene stands the little captain,
479 And to those themselves who sank in the sea!
1576 Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth,
1661 (No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death.)
1266 Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?
89 Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?
1390 Whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars, markets, newspapers, schools,
981 At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice through a straw,
775 Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,
696 This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.
447 A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,
1508 Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,
1260 
402 The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled neck,
946 Along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,
1160 
318 To niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing,
524 I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.
309 The negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and tall he stands pois’d on one leg on the string-piece,
24 The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.
1569 Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,
707 Mix’d tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!
317 In me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as forward sluing,
1021 Speeding with tail’d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,
634 Here or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time absolutely.
383 As the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them from his saddle,
216 The flap of the curtain’d litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital,
1383 Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking,
972 Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,
1387 A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.
381 Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece;
100 But they are not the Me myself.
43 Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?
1529 Every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what grows after and out of itself,
1614 
699 Translucent mould of me it shall be you!
1167 Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,
980 At he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking, laughter,
1058 
122 And reach’d till you felt my beard, and reach’d till you held my feet.
295 12
694 Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch’d from,
1214 Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering groan,
1530 And the dark hush promulges as much as any.
995 Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,
585 
556 The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me,
593 We must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of sight of the land,
35 The sound of the belch’d words of my voice loos’d to the eddies of the wind,
756 I underlying causes to balance them at last,
1180 
677 Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,
1626 If you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore,
683 Through me forbidden voices,
675 Voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves,
813 
1308 Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,
449 
1106 Again the attacking cannon, mortars,
553 
1153 Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?
415 The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his axe,
271 Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.
1498 
1475 I do not call one greater and one smaller,
1059 I understand the large hearts of heroes,
860 (What is less or more than a touch?)
665 
1164 We had receiv’d some eighteen pound shots under the water,
