1707 I do not know it—it is without name—it is a word unsaid,
1659 And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,
1178 Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,
1105 Again the long roll of the drummers,
1232 Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp,
1176 If our colors are struck and the fighting done?
539 I see that the elementary laws never apologize,
414 Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen surface,
411 In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers;
1101 
1279 You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.
1558 I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured and never will be measured.
30 
528 
1474 
1487 All below duly travel’d, and still I mount and mount.
1585 And my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond.
1513 
450 I resist any thing better than my own diversity,
1462 It is time to explain myself—let us stand up.
219 The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,
1399 I know perfectly well my own egotism,
363 The pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong arm,
507 Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;
1565 But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,
1347 Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,
1222 And feel the dull unintermitted pain.
1196 
99 These come to me days and nights and go from me again,
1227 Not a mutineer walks handcuff’d to jail but I am handcuff’d to him and walk by his side,
1216 
206 The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,
547 And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten million years,
703 You my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!
816 
1441 I take my place among you as much as among any,
11 My tongue, every atom of my blood, form’d from this soil, this air,
145 Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,
599 Sea of the brine of life and of unshovell’d yet always-ready graves,
701 Firm masculine colter it shall be you!
810 Mine is no callous shell,
1332 Magnifying and applying come I,
725 The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,
1331 
1212 Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,
455 The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their place,
440 At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and tacking,
280 You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.
1671 Others will punctually come for ever and ever.
535 I know I shall not pass like a child’s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night.
1093 
841 
79 
1064 How he follow’d with them and tack’d with them three days and would not give it up,
430 I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,
948 Prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,
978 Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,
915 Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?
1126 Retreating they had form’d in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks,
1307 To any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the door.
1442 The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,
472 I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.
213 The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,
584 Smile, for your lover comes.
169 And what do you think has become of the women and children?
1254 Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,
1217 37
138 
504 I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.
1438 How they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts of blood!
828 Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,
1071 The disdain and calmness of martyrs,
481 And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!
417 Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through those drain’d by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas,
1401 And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.
1657 And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes.
534 I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter’s compass,
207 I peeringly view them from the top.
1724 (Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)
1235 Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,
1107 Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.
373 He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript;
1741 I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.
951 Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the otter is feeding on fish,
898 I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.
1542 There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,
14 Hoping to cease not till death.
1570 You must travel it for yourself.
331 And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me,
929 His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.
488 The heavy-lipp’d slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;
1658 
391 The one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne her first child,
918 Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,
1225 It is I let out in the morning and barr’d at night.
518 Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids, conformity goes to the fourth-remov’d,
1120 Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,
1697 I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,
304 Overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,
1526 
680 Of the deform’d, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,
199 I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,
1033 I help myself to material and immaterial,
1607 The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power, but in his own right,
1155 List to the yarn, as my grandmother’s father the sailor told it to me.
601 I am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.
293 They do not think whom they souse with spray.
1283 
497 Well I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the side of a rock has.
1144 Some half-kill’d attempted to crawl away,
900 32
1035 
705 My brain it shall be your occult convolutions!
361 The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp,
236 
94 The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,
551 I laugh at what you call dissolution,
495 
1490 Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even there,
1336 Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,
849 Parting track’d by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,
131 And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap’d stones, elder, mullein and poke-weed.
1208 Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars,
17 Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,
640 Materialism first and last imbuing.
663 Unscrew the locks from the doors!
544 And if each and all be aware I sit content.
635 
760 My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am,
1287 
693 
470 
1088 I am the mash’d fireman with breast-bone broken,
559 I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,
146 And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,
1473 And other births will bring us richness and variety.
945 By the city’s quadrangular houses—in log huts, camping with lumbermen,
1693 Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,
975 Where the dense-starr’d flag is borne at the head of the regiments,
1258 Eleves, I salute you! come forward!
1485 My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,
181 I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.
1358 By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator,
871 And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,
1683 I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish’d breasts of melons.
508 How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?
1177 
1000 Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,
1579 If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip,
1206 The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,
1597 
611 What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?
1400 Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less,
1445 I do not know what is untried and afterward,
815 To touch my person to some one else’s is about as much as I can stand.
517 
939 And again as I walk’d the beach under the paling stars of the morning.
1109 I take part, I see and hear the whole,
273 She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,
1431 One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like a man leaving charges before a journey.
1613 And those well-tann’d to those that keep out of the sun.
1372 Music rolls, but not from the organ,
349 Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,
1024 Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,
1620 (It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of you,
1295 And any thing I have I bestow.
367 The deacons are ordain’d with cross’d hands at the altar,
184 And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,
993 Where band-neck’d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out,
952 Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,
310 His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hip-band,
674 Through me many long dumb voices,
1518 My lovers suffocate me,
710 Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!
23 I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,
916
