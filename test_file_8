1075 All these I feel or am.
1302 And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.
1055 
685 Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur’d.
831 Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,
780 The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color’d lights,
387 The squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm’d cloth is offering moccasins and bead-bags for sale,
829 They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me,
932 Why do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?
1669 I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign’d by God’s name,
263 And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,
1449 
622 
682 
778 The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a death-sentence,
1673 49
1129 They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv’d writing and seal, gave up their arms and march’d back prisoners of war.
558 
1257 
211 
1099 Distant and dead resuscitate,
750 Walt you contain enough, why don’t you let it out then?
858 They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,
437 A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin leggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,
1175 The other asks if we demand quarter?
545 
1594 Long enough have you dream’d contemptible dreams,
233 I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,
267 
1410 The saints and sages in history—but you yourself?
1318 
670 
1392 
1380 Ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,
730 
327 I believe in those wing’d purposes,
1733 Who wishes to walk with me?
1354 The bull and the bug never worshipp’d half enough,
244 The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud,
188 I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself,
1330 It is middling well as far as it goes—but is that all?
1624 And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air.
615 
186 
1087 
1325 I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,
1057 They fetch my man’s body up dripping and drown’d.
1533 And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems.
1393 The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and tail’d coats,
74 Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,
1749 
66 To elaborate is no avail, learn’d and unlearn’d feel that it is so.
754 Waiting in gloom, protected by frost,
1320 Not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,
1456 Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in,
1510 
1042 I take my place late at night in the crow’s-nest,
424 The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife;
970 Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,
1615 I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?
185 The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.
214 The snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,
1720 And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.
1722 Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?
1675 
287 
202 8
401 The opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open’d lips,
245 
736 The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!
1004 Pleas’d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously,
426 And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,
1599 Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,
1414 43
1171 The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,
792 A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,
218 The excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd,
333 
1048 We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still feet and caution,
338 Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.
1056 My voice is the wife’s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,
155 It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers’ laps,
179 7
1136 
369 The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe and looks at the oats and rye,
761 Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,
180 Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?
427 And of these one and all I weave the song of myself.
33 My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs,
647 
1425 Accepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is divine,
246 My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.
1735 Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?
1479 I am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,
1195 His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.
817 28
302 From the cinder-strew’d threshold I follow their movements,
767 
1625 
568 It is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and still pass on.
2 
884 I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots,
592 I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,
791 
989 Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near,
1115 
1502 
136 
1294 I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to spare,
1213 The hiss of the surgeon’s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,
560 And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,
1713 Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters.
859 The insignificant is as big to me as any,
823 Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,
221 What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes,
1189 The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.
98 Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful events;
355 Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,
1069 I am the man, I suffer’d, I was there.
746 With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.
620 Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,
356 Not asking the sky to come down to my good will,
1434 Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten’d, atheistical,
743 We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.
1362 A call in the midst of the crowd,
894 In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,
346 They scorn the best I can do to relate them.
595 Dash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.
880 And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,
1725 
785 I hear the violoncello, (’tis the young man’s heart’s complaint,)
1589 
1643 The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,
1247 
292 They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch,
1491 I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist,
994 Where burial coaches enter the arch’d gates of a cemetery,
1249 I resume the overstaid fraction,
1026 
1641 
1417 Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern,
230 The armfuls are pack’d to the sagging mow.
158 This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,
920 Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,
150 And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.
897 In vain the razor-bill’d auk sails far north to Labrador,
617 Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work’d over and rectified?
597 Sea of stretch’d ground-swells,
259 Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,
956 Over the western persimmon, over the long-leav’d corn, over the delicate blue-flower flax,
520 
1455 Nor the numberless slaughter’d and wreck’d, nor the brutish koboo call’d the ordure of humanity,
496 Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?
774 I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,
1012 By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,
1646 They and all would resume what I have told them.
1636 In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen and love them.
166 And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps.
1398 
209 The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,
591 I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers,
1297 I do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,
1397 Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them.
1511 All forces have been steadily employ’d to complete and delight me,
976 Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,
1016 Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,
1688 I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,
203 The little one sleeps in its cradle,
1312 O despairer, here is my neck,
1603 I am the teacher of athletes,
588 
872 And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific,
465 This the common air that bathes the globe.
160 Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.
256 
1036 I anchor my ship for a little while only,
